This semester has been one of considerable learning and growth. Through the course, I could get hands-on practice in using design thinking for the solving of real-world problems. The project dealing with vending machine technologies' enhancement using AI and IoT highlighted much on effectively responding to users and operators. I also enhanced my critical thinking and problem-solving skills, especially in identifying core issues and designing innovative solutions. Furthermore, this teamwork developed my teamwork and communication skills, and the tasks of prototyping and testing developed further learning about technology applications such as AI-driven inventory management and IoT-based monitoring systems.

While enriching, there were also some areas for improvement in the experience. The brainstorming sessions could be made a little early so that more time is spent on perfecting prototypes and integrating user feedback. Time management have to be cultivated in order to complete the project on time.

This semester has been a very enriching experience that has not only helped me improve in my technical skills but also contributed much to personal growth. It taught me the way to balance creativity with technical know-how and the value of diverse perspectives in arriving at better solutions. This course has motivated me to research further the possibilities of AI and IoT in other fields, such as healthcare or education, and to pursue more certifications to enhance my skills.
