## Self-ReflectionðŸ˜Žâœ¨: 
The talk showed a comprehensive picture in Petronas Digital's Young Graduate Program (YGP) and roles of Software Engineer, Data Engineer and Data Scientist. Every position was linked to the ability and the understanding we acquired during this semesterâ€™s course work (problem-solving, programming, data analytics and system design). Specifying real-world examples, e.g., software design, data pipeline management, and business requirements analysis, clearly bridged theoretical concepts and industry implementation. This entanglement strengthened our understanding of the importance of digital skills in the engine of innovation.

The talk could be improved by including more pictures on the daily work of each role so that students can gain a better understanding on respective role. To sum up, this talk was highly motivating, showcasing how digital skills contribute to solving industry challenges. Moreover, advice from YGP graduates emphasized continuous learning, equipping ourselves with skills for better opportunities, and being prepared for hard work and commitment. In a nutshell, this talk provided meaningful insights into the importance of these roles in advancing technology and solving challenges in the industry.
