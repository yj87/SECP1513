## Self-Reflection: 
The talk provided a comprehensive overview of Petronas Digital's Young Graduate Program (YGP) and the roles of Software Engineer, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist. Each role was linked to skills and knowledge from our courses this semester, such as problem-solving, programming, data analytics, and system design. The explanation of real-world applications, such as designing software, managing data pipelines, and analyzing business needs, helped connect theoretical knowledge to industry practices. This integration enhanced our understanding of the importance of digital skills in advancing technology.

The talk could be improved by including more pictures on the daily work of each role so that students can gain a better understanding on respective role. To sum up, this talk was highly motivating, showcasing how digital skills contribute to solving industry challenges. Moreover, advice from YGP graduates emphasized continuous learning, equipping ourselves with skills for better opportunities, and being prepared for hard work and commitment. In a nutshell, this talk provided meaningful insights into the importance of these roles in advancing technology and solving challenges in the industry.
