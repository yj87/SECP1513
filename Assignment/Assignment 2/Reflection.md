## Self-Reflection on the VisitðŸ˜Žâœ¨

Visiting UTMDigital was a worthwhile and exciting experience. During the visit, I also learnt the practical applications of IT systems such as the UTM's Wi-Fi and wired networks, as well as the aspect of data engineering, through the workshop. Seeing these systems in action helped bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, deepening our understanding of the course material. Moreover, this visit also provide me the chance to visit the open office, Sangfor Room and Digital Care room which gave me a preview into where I will be after graduation and started my career.   

To further enhance the learning experience, future visits could include hands-on workshops or interactive sessions where students can try out the technologies that are related to our program which is Computer Network and Security. For example, visit to UTM CyberX Lab. Furthermore, offering pre-visit materials or learning guides might enable the students to get better prepared and be aware of the situation prior to arrival. In general, the trip was a tremendously useful academic experience providing useful knowledge and motivation.
