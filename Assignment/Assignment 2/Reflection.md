## Reflection on the Visit

The visit to UTMDigital was a valuable and enriching experience. From the visit, I can gained insight into real-world examples of IT systems, such as UTMâ€™s Wi-Fi and wired networks, and data engineering through the workshop conducted. Seeing these systems in action helped bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, deepening our understanding of the course material. Moreover, this visit also provide me the chance to visit the open office, Sangfor Room and Digital Care room gave me a preview into where I will be after graduation and started my career.   

To further enhance the learning experience, future visits could include hands-on workshops or interactive sessions where students can try out the technologies that are related to our program which is Computer Network and Security. For example, visit to UTM CyberX Lab. Additionally, providing pre-visit materials or guides could help students better prepare and understand the context of the visit.  Overall, the visit was a highly beneficial learning experience that provided valuable knowledge and inspiration.
