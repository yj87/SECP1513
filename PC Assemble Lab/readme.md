# **PC ASSEMBLE LAB**

## **Introduction**
A PC assembly lab was conducted on 6<sup>th</sup> November 2024, Monday at N28. This lab aims to familiarize students 
with the hardware component of the computer and introduce the simple steps to disassemble and assemble the PC to the students. After the lab, a quiz about the lab was required to be answered by the students.

## **Outcomes**
Throughout this lab, steps and ways to disassemble and assemble a PC were acquired, for example, to disassemble a PC, we have to start by:
1. Open the casing.
2. Unplug all the cables.
3. Remove the power supply unit.
4. Remove the Random Access Memory(RAM).
5. Remove the hard disk drives(HDD).
6. Remove the CPU Fan.

On the other hand, to assemble the PC, we have to do it the opposite way:
1. Open the casing
2. Install the CPU Fan.
3. Install the HDD.
4. Install the RAM
5. Install the power supply unit.
6. Plug all the cables.
7. Close the casing.
8. Test with monitor.

Moreover, we have learned about hardware components such as HDD, CPU Fan, RAM, and power supply unit and have hands-on experience connecting each element to its slot.
